# team-profile-generator

## About This Project

### The purpose of this project was to develop a team-profile generator that prompts the user with a series of questions regarding different types of employees (Manager, Engineer, Intern) and allows the user to input information pertained to each type of employee. The generator then outputs an HTML document with a displayed version of each team member type and their specific information. 

## How To Use

#### Simply run the "node index.js" function in your terminal to activate the userQuestions() function, which will then walk you through a series of prompts to fill in. Select all members of your team. When you are done adding team members, select the "Nobody else" response. The HTML file will generate inside the output folder. Open this file in the default browser and enjoy!
